To use this you must first install:
    emokit - https://github.com/qdot/emokit and all it need to run in python
    pygame 

Then plug the emotiv in your PC and run the readEmotivData.py in sudo (don't know how to do it in Windows) press leftShift + 0 or 1 or ... or A or B .. G to see the graphics closer.

If you press r you can record the signals they will appear in signals/teste.txt

Then you can rename it and play it by altering the loadEmotivData.py
